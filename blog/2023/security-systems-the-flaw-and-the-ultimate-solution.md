From the lock and key to the computer and smartphone PINs and passwords, the systems that secure your valuables have been not very intelligent.
1. The authentication system rely on simple factors like keys/passwords which are prone to losing/forgetting.
2. They really don't know if the right person is accessing the valuable or not.
A bad guy who has the key or knows the password can easily break the protection barrier.

### Moving on from conventional security: Biometrics

The biometrics system really tried to solve the above two problems. It was only possible with the sophistication of technology, hence we're enjoying the security of
**fingerprints**, **face ID**, etc. these days. But unfortunately, 
1. Still many websites and apps require you to type some password. Because they can't access the fingerprint/infrared interface of the hardware that you're using.
2. Even relying on just your fingerprint or facial recognition means that it's only relying on _one_ factor.
In case you bruise your finger or face (Apple confidently said that its face ID technology adapts to your changing face with beards, etc),
these devices still ask for a PIN or a password. So basically a PIN or a password are still the ultimate layer of security, because guess what,
they really aren't smart enough to detect if its really _you_ or hacker.

### The Ultimate Level Security

What if the security system was as good as a human being in intelligence? What if the security system is powered by AI? Then,
**Pros:**
1. It can _really_ detect if its you or not, even if you bruise your finger or damage your face.
You see, human decision making is not simple or based on 1 or 2 factors. Its complex, based on multiple factors, and there are fuzzy areas.
A sufficiently good AI can authenticate based on multiple factors without the use of additional dependencies like passowrds or keys.

**Cons**
Some of the flaws of humans may get slipped into the AI as well. A simple one factor key or password is hard to crack if it's made sufficiently tough.
An AI, being as complex as it is, has many factors and doors open to manipulate/interact.

But of course, that can be modified as the AI need not necessarily have all the human flaws.
They don't forget, for example. We can design it in such a way that it also doesn't fall to emotional or hypnotic traps.

A solid AI-powered security system, is hence the ultimate security system.
