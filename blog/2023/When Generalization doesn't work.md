A belief or technique that works in one arena doesn't work in another. Things are intricate and unique, all fields require their own attention.

Microsoft thought that the smarphone should look like a computer OS. Apple took an entirely different approach to the smartphone, and it was specialized for its form factor. 
This is one of the reasons Microsoft failed at the smartphone industry.

### Apple couldn't to the TV what it did to the smartphone industry

As [Steve Jobs himself put it(in 2010)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5f8bqYYwps&t=3675s), 1. Even if they design the best set-top-box, it was hard to get into the market. The existing market used the Go-To-Market strategy and the set-top boxes were subsidized. 2. The cable operators fragmented, every country has it's own standards and regulations.

### Wework is filing for bankruptcy

Wework couldn't succeed and one of the reasons is because the office industry is fragmented. Their idea of one office-space works-for-all didn't exactly work.

### Netflix Games

Netflix tried to apply its subscription model to the video game industry with its service Netflix Games, but it was cancelled after less than a year due to low subscriber engagement. The selection and type of games didn't exactly pick up with neither the pro gamers nor the casual gamers.

### Sometimes you can enter a totally different market, like Uber/Ola did, and be successful

The taxi industry was and is still run by the locals. Uber/Ola had to enter an already established market and compete with them. The reason why they were successful is that, ultimately the customer wants convenience and cheap rides. The quick access through the app, the various options available and a bit of safety assurance made Uber successful.

## The Reasons they failed

The reasons all the above companies failed (among other reasons) is that they all had a fixed mindset on how things are supposed to work. 
Successful products were never launched with a fixed product and an idea/belief that worked in another area. They had embraced a little uncertainity.
They also didn't understand that people are inventing use-cases constantly. Steve Jobs and his team had no idea how much the idea of an app store and apps would explode. 

The art lies in balancing the well-known fixed notions with some uncertainity.
