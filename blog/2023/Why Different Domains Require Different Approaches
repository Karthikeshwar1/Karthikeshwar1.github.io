Different domains require different approaches. What works in one field may not work in another. Each area has its own complexities and nuances that demand careful attention.

### Microsft's failure in the smartphone industry

Microsoft assumed that the smartphone should resemble a computer OS. 
Apple, on the other hand, adopted a completely different strategy for the smartphone, and tailored it to its form factor. This is one of the main reasons why Microsoft failed to capture the smartphone market.

### Apple couldn't to the TV what it did to the smartphone industry

As [Steve Jobs himself put it(in 2010)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5f8bqYYwps&t=3675s), 1. Even if they design the best set-top-box, it was hard to get into the market. The existing market used the Go-To-Market strategy and the set-top boxes were subsidized. 2. The cable operators fragmented, every country has it's own standards and regulations.

### WeWork is filing for bankruptcy

WeWork failed to succeed and one of the factors was the fragmentation of the office industry. Their concept of a one-size-fits-all office space did not work well.

<br>

### Netflix Games

Netflix tried to apply its subscription model to the video game industry with its service Netflix Games, but it was cancelled after less than a year due to low subscriber engagement. The selection and type of games didn't exactly pick up with neither the pro gamers nor the casual gamers.

### Sometimes you can enter a totally different market, like Uber/Ola did, and be successful

The taxi industry was and still is (in some places) dominated by the locals. Uber/Ola had to enter an already established market and compete with them. The reason why they were successful is that they understood what the customer wanted: convenience and affordability. The easy access through the app, the variety of options available, and a bit of safety assurance made Uber/Ola popular.

<br>

## The Reasons they failed

The reasons all the above companies failed (among other reasons) is that they all had a fixed mindset on how things are supposed to work. 
Successful products were never launched with a fixed product and an idea/belief that worked in another area. They had embraced a little uncertainity.
They also didn't understand that people are inventing use-cases constantly. Steve Jobs and his team had no idea how much the idea of an app store and apps would explode. 

The art lies in balancing the well-known fixed notions with some uncertainity.
