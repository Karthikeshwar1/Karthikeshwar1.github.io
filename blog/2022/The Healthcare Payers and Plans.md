## 👨 Customers and Payers

* In healthcare & life sciences industry, the user and purchaser of healthcare services aren't usually the same.
* Healthcare payers serve:
  * **Patients:** Individuals who receive medical care
    * Primary beneficiary: Those eligible for health insurance plans (e.g. employees in employer-sponsored health plans)
    * Secondary beneficiary: Those who receive same benefits as primary one because of their relationship with a primary beneficiary (spouse or child below a certain age)
  * **Sponsors:** Sometimes companies contract with third-party companies to offer healthcare services to their employees, which is called sponsoring
* Healthcare payers include:
	1. Providers
	2. Patients
	3. Third-party payers

<br>

## 📄 Healthcare Plans

* Could be:
  1. Group health insurance plans (e.g. employee health insurance)
  2. Individual/private/personal health insurance
  3. Specialty healthcare insurance plans (like dental or vision plans)

* US healthcare plans types:
  * **Health Maintenance Organization (HMO):**
    * A type of health insurance plan that usually limits coverage to care from doctors who work for or contract with the HMO
    * It generally won't cover out-of-network care except in an emergency
    * An HMO may require you to live or work in its service area to be eligible for coverage
  * **Point Of Service (POS):**
    * Health insurance policy that allows the employee to choose between in-network and out-of-network healthcare products and services each time
  * **Preferred Provider Organization (PPO):**
    * Medicare arrangement where availing medical services like consultations, hospitals and medicines are all provided for a cost lesser than it usually is under this plan
    * Have higher premiums and higher level of cost-sharing than HMO or POS plans

<br>

## 👨‍💻 Claims Processing

* Also called Claims Adjudication
* It's the insurance company's procedure to check the claim requests for adequate information, validation, justification and authenticity
* Many payers outsource claims processing to other payers
* Claims processing begins when a provider delivers medical care to a patient
* The medical care provided is translated into numeric codes. This is called Medical Coding
* Most common codes set used is **International Classification Of Diseases (ICD)**
* Once medical coding is complete, providers generate a claim, a process called as **Medical Billing**
* Claim includes:
  * Patient information
  * Medical codes
  * Provider information
* The claim is then submitted to the payer
* The provider may also submit the claims to the Clearinghouse which sends the claims to appropriate payers
* Once claims reach payers, claims examiners/claims adjusters examine:
  * Patient eligibility
  * Provider credentials and Rate agreements
  * Medical necessity
* Some claims are approved by **auto-adjudication**, without manual intervention
* Once the payer pays the bill to the provider, an Explanation of Benefits is sent to the patient, providing information about the claim status (if claim was directly submitted by patient, payment is also forwarded to the patient)
* Information on claim status is sent back to provider
* A claim could be:
  * **_Rejected:**_ because of incomplete/inaccurate information
  * _**Denied:**_ because the claim has been determined as not-payable
