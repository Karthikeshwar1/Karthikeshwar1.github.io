## 🩺 Provider Technology

#### Medical technology: 
  * tech used to diagnose, monitor and treat medical conditions
#### Information technology used by healthcare providers: 
  * different from MedTech
  * Types:
    * Clinical information management system or Clinical decision support systems
    * Administrative systems, operational systems, or health information management systems
  * IT systems:
    * **Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and Electronic Health Records (EHR)**
      * EMRs are patient records stored digitally within a specific health care organization
      * EHRs are EMRs standardized and shared across multiple healthcare organizations (and sometimes payers) through secure health information exchanges or other networks
    * **Nurses Stations**
      * Allow on-duty nurses to manage the care of their patients by prioritizing tasks, reviewing medical information, documenting activities performed
    * **Laboratories**
      * Labs use complex, highly automated medical equipment to test patient's blood, urine, tissues, etc. 
      * This equipment is increasingly integrated with IT apps to improve efficiency and quality
    * **Finance**
      * Many finance systems used by healthcare providers are similar to those found in other large companies
      * More specialized finance systems found in healthcare providers include:
        * Patient accounting systems
        * Billing (A/R) systems that include medical coding software, claims preparation, electronic claim submissions in payer-compliant transaction formats, denials management and collections
        * Contract management systems to manage relationships with multiple payers
        * Supply chain management systems that integrate with departmental applications to optimize inventory levels
      * These financial systems are sometimes referred to as revenue cycle management systems
    * **Radiology**
      * Radiology uses x-ray equipment, MRI equipment, etc. to create images of patients to diagnose and monitor medical conditions
      * These high-resolution images are forwarded to the Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS) typically located in hospital's data center
      * Once in PACS, these images are available for other medical professionals to review
      * In more advanced IT ecosystems, these images are automatically linked to patient electronic medical records

## 🤔 Industry Challenges

	• Pressure on profitability
	• Cost control
		○ To lower healthcare costs, payers are:
			§ Lowering reimbursement rates to providers
			§ Developing alternative payment models
			§ Rationing patient access to healthcare
			§ Increasing patient cost-sharing
		○ These measures put pressure on provider profitability. In response, providers try to:
			§ Control costs
			§ Grow revenue
		○ Providers are employing various measures to overcome all of their challenges
	• Revenue growth
	• Regulatory compliance
		○ Most important regulations and mandates:
			§ Cybersecurity (regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR)
			§ Value-based care initiatives
				□ Traditionally, it has been fee-for-service (FFS), which has disadvantages
				□ Value-based care initiatives increases the incentives for providers to provide quality healthcare. Providers are payed based on patient outcomes, rather than the number of tests and treatments
				□ Value-based reimbursement methods require providers to meet payer-mandated metrics for quality, efficiency and patient safety
				□ Opinion-based medicine -> Evidence-based medicine
				□ Volume-based reimbursement -> Value-based reimbursement
				□ In the US, Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) requires Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) to manage a quality payment incentive program that rewards value and outcomes
				□ CMS does this through:
					® Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS)
					® Alternative Payment Models (APMs)
						◊ Bundled payments
						◊ Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)
	• Improving patient experience
		○ Drivers for improving patient experience:
			§ Growing payer emphasis on patient experience as a part of quality care
			§ Increasing engagement by patients in their own healthcare
			§ A desire by providers to strengthen patient loyalty through a sense of membership
		○ Strategies:
			§ Employing portals and other self-service healthcare tools
			§ Easier access to health information
			§ Training staff to improve communication and responsiveness
			§ Implementing analytics to better understand customer needs and personalize interactions
			§ Using telemedicine
	• Shortage of healthcare workers
		○ Reasons:
			§ Emerging markets
			§ Aging populations
		○ Impact:
			§ Longer wait times to receive medical care
			§ Reduced access to care, mostly in rural areas
			§ Increased focus on alternative delivery models, such as retail clinics and telemedicine
	• Pandemic (COVID-19)
		○ Impact:
			§ Scramble to get extra beds, masks, oxygen, etc.
			§ Expand hospital capacities
			§ Use non-medical facilities and erect temporary field hospitals
			§ Call for additional healthcare workers, including retired medical professionals and medical students
		○ Providers have suffered financial implications, due to:
			§ Cost to treat COVID-19 soared
			§ Revenue fell, because healthcare facilities limit non-emergency surgeries to free up beds for COVID-19 patients; and patients postpone medical appointments to avoid virus contact
		○ Pandemic forced provides for implementing more innovative ways of providing medical care:
			§ Use of telemedicine has increased
			§ In-home screenings have increased (self-testing/diagnosis at home)
