# Myths

* Genes don't determine our lives. It's our environment which determines which genes get activated/expressed. So it's we who control our lives.
  * 99% of diseases didn't come from genes but from lifestyle and environment [1]
  * Our genes make their day to day decisions based on chemical information they receive from the food we eat [2]
  * We can change the expression of more than 70% of the genes that have a direct bearing on our health and longevity [3]
* There are good and bad calories. 100 calories of doughnuts isn't the same as 100 calories of spinach.
  * Even if you take 1000 calories per day, if it's 90% carbohydrates, then you'll gain weight. If it's 90% fat or protein, you'll lose weight.
  * When insulin levels are elevated, we accumulate fat in our fat tissue, when these levels fall, we liberate fat from our fat tissue and burn it for fuel [4]
  * Carbohydrate is driving insulin. Insulin is driving fat. [5]
* Artificial substitutes of natural food items could be bad, coz our body, through evolution, is more suited to natural food.
  * Fat and cholesterol aren't the sole reasons why heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, etc. are caused
  * Eat more natural food

# What to avoid

* Avoid artificial fats. Refined bleached deodorized vegetable oils are the most dangerous.
  * Vegetable oils are highly chemically unstable. They oxidize. So they're harmful. They increase inflammation, which contributes to just about every chronic disease. 
  * Plant foods contains 64 times more anti-oxidants than animal foods
  * Vegetable oils are undoubtedly the most unnatural product we eat in any significant amount, says Dr. Cate [2]
  * Harmful fats: Sunflower oil, rice bran oil, canola oil, soy oil, cottonseed oil, grapeseed oil, safflower oil
  * Safe fats: avocado oil, macadamia nut oil, olive oil, peanut oil, butter, ghee, coconut oil, animal fats
* Avoid harmful carbs. Sugar is present in most food, and is dangerous.
  * 2 Whole wheat bread slices are equivalent to a can of sugar-sweetened soda
  * Bread, pasta, potatoes, rice are little more than containers for sugar. A 7 ounce serving of cooked spaghetti is converted into the amount of sugar contained in 4 twelve-ounce Pepsi cans! [2]
  * Abdominal fat is the signature pattern of weight gain from a diet based on wheat and grains [7]
  * Vegetables contain a higher nutrient energy ratio than fruits. Fruits contain more sugar
* Avoid fake food. Processed food are harmful.
  * Avoid western and processed food
  * Something which says gluten free, probably has something worse 
  * By avoiding processed food, you naturally avoid toxic oils and sugars

# Eating better food

* 80% of food must be plants
* Eat 1-2 pounds of vegetables a day and 20 different species a week
* Use turmeric (highly anti-oxidant, fights inflammation), ginger (boosts immunity), lemon (vitamin C), black pepper
* Herbs and spices have the most anti-oxidants
