##  üë® Customers

* Patients: ultimate beneficiaries of medical technology
* Providers: make decisions in purchasing and using the medical technology. Group Purchase Organizations (GPOs) represent multiple hospitals/healthcare professionals and negotiate discounts with medical technology companies
* Payers: the ones who pay for the medical technology. Medtech are assessed before purchasing

<br>

## üè• MedTech Industry Participants

* **Medical Technology Companies**
  * Large MedTech Companies (e.g. Johnson & Johnson, GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Medtronic, Abbott Labs, Becton Dickinson)
  * Small MedTech Companies (e.g. startups)
* **Biopharma Companies**
  * Lines between biopharma and medtech companies is blurring
* **Healthcare IT Companies (HCIT)**
