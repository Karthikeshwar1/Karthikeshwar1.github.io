## Legendary papers and blogs

* Richard Sutton's [Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html):
General methods leveraging computation and learning, rather than human-designed knowledge or rules, are the most effective path to achieving significant progress in AI.
* [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762): The landmark Google paper introducing transformers based on attention mechanism.


* [Many-Shot In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762):
  * With enough examples, many-shot ICL (In-Context Learning) can match or even surpass the performance of fine-tuned models on several tasks.
  * Many-shot ICL can override pretraining biases and learn high-dimensional functions (e.g., numerical tasks) where few-shot ICL struggles.
