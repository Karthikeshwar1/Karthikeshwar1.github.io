* 🧮 Computers find it easier to solve complex math than identify a fruit in a basket.  
* 🧠 Calculators were developed earlier than computer vision–capable machines.  
* 👁️‍🗨️ Humans can do computer vision tasks much better than complex math.

<br>

* 🌍 Species evolve out of nature, geography, and the need to replicate.  
* 🛠️ Humans build things out of necessity.  
* ⏩ The evolution of what we build is much faster (centuries/decades/months) than biological evolution (thousands of years).

* 🐟 A submarine doesn’t look like a fish, and an airplane doesn’t flap its wings.  
* ✈️ Both are much better at the core thing we want: travel in the ocean or air.  
* ⚙️ Maybe not as efficient as nature, but definitely faster and more powerful.  
* 🧬 Nature achieved efficiency over thousands of years through necessity.  
* 🔧 What we build outperforms nature on other benchmarks—because it's built for *our* needs.

<br>

* 🛞 The wheel is one of the best examples of something not built by nature.

<br>

* 🤖 The AI we want to build—or whatever humans may evolve into—doesn’t need to resemble the humans that came before.
