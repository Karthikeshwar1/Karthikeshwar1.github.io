* Computers find it easy to solve complex math than identify a fruit in a basket.
* Calculators were developed first than computer vision capable computers.
* Humans can do computer vision tasks much better than complex maths.

* Species evolve our of nature, geography and needs to repicate.
* Humans build things out of their necessity.
* Evolution of things we build is much faster (centuries/decades/months) than evolution (thousands of years)

* A submarine doesn't look like a fish, an airplane doesn't flap wings.
* Both are much better at the core things we want, travel in the ocean/air.
* Maybe not as efficient, but definitely much faster and powerful.
* Nature achieved efficiency out of thousands of years of its necessity. Things we build outpeferorm at other benchmarks, created for our needs.

* A wheel is one of the best examples that wasn't built by nature.

* The AI we want to build, or whatever humans will evolve into, need not be the same as previous humans.
