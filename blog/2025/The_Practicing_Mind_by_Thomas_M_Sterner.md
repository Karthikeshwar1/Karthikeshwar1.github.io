# The Practicing Mind - Book Notes

## Book by Thomas M. Sterner

<br>

"Master any skill or challenge by learning to love the process"

<br>

## 1. The Learning Begins

We do things like driving a car without much thinking. That comes from practice. Do everything from practice.

## 2. Process, Not Product

* When you're doing something, 'be here now!' Do not think about expectations, stress, how you're doing, etc.
* Make the 'process' the goal, not the 'product'. Product follows automatically once the process is done well.
* Do not learn passively, practive actively.

* To state Bhagavad Gita (not mentioned in the book):

```
Karmanye Vadhikaraste
(कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते): You have a right to perform your actions or duty.

Ma Phaleshu Kadachana
(मा फलेषु कदाचन): But never to the fruits of your actions.

Ma Karma Phala Hetur Bhur
(मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा): Never consider yourself the cause of the results.

Ma Te Sango 'Stvakarmaṇi
(ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि): And never be attached to not doing your duty.
```

* Be deliberate, have an intention about what you want to accomplish, and remain aware of that intention.

## 3. It's How You Look at It

"At what point in a flower's life, from seed to full bloom, does it reach perfection?"

* Do not keep expecting a future ideal self. Live in the present, every moment is ideal. Being here now is what most religions teach too.
