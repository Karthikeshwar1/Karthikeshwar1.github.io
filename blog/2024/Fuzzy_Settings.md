* The features and options in our technology is increasing day by day. One day, instead of too many options on screen (which is both hard to navigate and remember and design), we'll have fuzzy settings. Just a few intuitive buttons, - either very familiar or very easy to get used to.
* E.g., Edit button in all apps and sub-app screens - does everything you can imagine.
* Customize button in all places of OS - does anything you can imagine.
