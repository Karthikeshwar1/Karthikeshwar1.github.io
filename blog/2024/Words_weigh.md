# Words Weigh

Non-living objects communicate through physics (the 4 fundamental forces, chemical bonds, etc)

Non-human living objects (microscopic/animals/birds/etc.) communicate with a little more sophisticated ways, 
but they're not self-aware (not to level of humans). 
If some exceptional animal did learn to be self-aware, like a üê¨ or an ü¶ß, 
what it speaks wouldn't be understandable by its friends.

1. Human communication is a highly sophisticated mechanism, thanks to the big brain.
   This communication is a result of years of understanding of reality .
   Hence our words reflect the real world and its laws. 
2. Also, since humans are the most self-aware species, the words carry a lot of importance.
   Now, some animals can sing and have complicated sounds as well, but they're neither self-aware,
   nor do their sounds have the level of complexity as humans do. 
3. Also, a single human speaking in a desert carries no importance.
Hence, words only have meaning when the species is social.

Some holy scriptures (Hindu and Christian - I haven't read them) seemed to have said that the capacity that words have to shape reality is akin to the process that generates reality itself.
