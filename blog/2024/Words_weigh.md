# Words Weigh

Non-living objects communicate through physics (the 4 fundamental forces, chemical bonds, etc)

## 1

Non-human living objects (microscopic/animals/birds/etc.) communicate with a little more sophisticated ways, 
but they're not self-aware (not to level of humans). 
If some exceptional animal did learn to be self-aware, like a 🐬 or an 🦧, 
what it speaks wouldn't be understandable by its friends.

1. Human communication is a highly sophisticated mechanism, thanks to the big brain.
   This communication is a result of years of understanding of reality .
   Hence our words reflect the real world and its laws. 
2. Also, since humans are the most self-aware species, the words carry a lot of importance.
   Now, some animals can sing and have complicated sounds as well, but they're neither self-aware,
   nor do their sounds have the level of complexity as humans do. 
3. Also, a single human speaking in a desert carries no importance.
Hence, words only have meaning when the species is social.

Jordan Peterson, in his *Biblical Series* lectures, emphasizes this psychological and symbolic interpretation: that naming and narrative are the human methods of imposing order on a pre-existing chaos — the world already exists, but it becomes intelligible, usable, and meaningful once it is named and structured in language ([Jordan Peterson – Biblical Series](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/bible-series/)). (Also see my *Myth Truth* blog for a deeper discussion of this idea.)

Words also have importance in another way: nothing in this world had a *name* until humans named it. Meaning did not arise from atoms alone, but from symbols layered onto reality. The world may have existed before language, but it did not exist *as a world* — a structured domain of significance — until it was articulated.

This idea echoes powerfully in modern technology. Today’s large language models — the artificial “intelligence” we interact with — are built entirely from words. LLMs are statistical systems trained on massive corpora of text, learning relationships between symbols and generating new ones ([OpenAI – How ChatGPT Works](https://openai.com/research/chatgpt), [IBM – What Are Large Language Models?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models)). They demonstrate that words alone can generate planning, reasoning-like behavior, and creativity — while also reminding us that syntax and prediction are not the same as lived meaning.

Some holy scriptures (Hindu and Christian - I haven't read them) seemed to have said that the capacity that words have to shape reality is akin to the process that generates reality itself.
