👧: "what is a rectangle, mam? And what do these equations represent?"

🧑‍🏫: "It is an abstraction of what occurs in the real world."

👧: "But I don't see the rectangle, or these equations exactly the same way in the real world...!"

🧑‍🏫: "That's right! A condensed abstraction is much easier to understand, calculate, study and build upon. They're not supposed to be real, but in a way,

_They're more real than reality itself_"

Myth entities like the Greek Gods or Hindu Gods including evil characters - they represent real archetypes.
They are the shapes or equations that we see in a book, and represent all reality, but not present in reality itself.

Let's call the myth world and the world where mathematics recide as _'meta world'_. 
1. Does it precede our reality?
2. We certainly didn't fully create mathematics or the myths.
3. Did it _emerge_ as we evolved?

* Meaning occurs as a result of [recursion](https://karthikeshwar1.github.io/blog/2023/What%27s%20the%20book%20GEB%20all%20about) and [emergence](https://karthikeshwar1.github.io/blog/2025/Emergence_and_Meaning).
* Real world entities and abstract entities in _meta world_ only have meaning when we [Humans give meaning](https://karthikeshwar1.github.io/blog/2024/Words_weigh) to them. 
Maybe because we cannot have a view other than a selfish view.
* Even mathematics doesn't have any meaning [without Human connection (as verified by a noteworthy mathematician)](https://x.com/getjonwithit/status/2009602836997505255).
