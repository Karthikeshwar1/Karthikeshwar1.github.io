"what is a rectangle, mam? And what do these equations represent?"

"It is an abstraction of what occurs in the real world."

"But I don't see the rectangle, or these equations exactly the same way in the real world...!"

"That's right! A condensed abstraction is much easier to understand, calculate, study and build upon. They're not supposed to be real, but in a way,

_They're more real than reality itself_"

<br>

Christ, Krishna, and all the evil Gods or entities like Ravan, Herod - they represent real archetypes.
They are the shapes or equations that we see in a book, and represent all reality, but not present in reality itself.
