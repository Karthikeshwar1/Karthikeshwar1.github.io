    "content": "<h1 align=\"center\"> The Vital Question <h2 align=\"center\">My notes on Nick Lane's book</h2> </h1> <br> ## Introduction: Why is Life the way it is? * Some structures inside complex cells look and behave like bacteria, perhaps they are! * Lynn Margulis came up with 'serial endosymbiosis theory': The idea that complex eukaryotic cells are an ensemble of bacteria. * But that has far less to support it, there's nothing in the genes to suggest it. * Francis Crick, 1958: \"Biologists should realise that before long we shall have a subject which might be called 'portein taxonomy - the study of amino acid sequences of proteins of an organism and the comparison of them between species. It can be argued that these sequences are the most delicate expression possible of the phenotype of an organism and the vast amounts of evolutionary information may be hidden away within them.\" * Indeed, biology is now very much about the info concealed in the sequences of proteins and genes. * Instead of amino acids, we now compare the sequences of letters in DNA, giving greater sensitivity. * We know that complex cells arose on just one occasion in 4 billion years of evolution, through a singular endosymbiosis between an archaeon and a bacterium. * So it seems that there are 3 big unknowns at the very heart of biology today: 1. why life evolved in the perplexing way it did? 2. why cells are poweredin such a peculiar fashion? <br> ## PART 1: THE PROBLEM ## What is Life? * Your software is built by source code üñ•Ô∏è. Living organisms are built by genomes üß¨. * **Genomes do not predict the future but recall the past: they reflect the exigencies of history.** * Dialectical materialism: Genes <--> environment, aka nature and nurture. Biology is all about genes, and their behaviour is all about the environment. * All plants, animals, algae, fungi and protists share a common ancestor - the eukaryotes are _monophyletic_. * Almost all the genes inolved (encoding so-called eukaryotic \"signature proteins\") are not found in prokaryotes. Conversely, bacteria show practically no tendency to evolve any of these complex eukaryotic traits. There are no known evolutionary intermediates between the morphologically simple state of all prokaryotes and the disturbingly complex ancestor of eukaryotes. All these attributes of complex life arose in a _phylogenetic_ void, a **black hole** at the heart of biology. * 'The Origin of Species' by Darwin made the point that natural selection actually predicts that intermediate should be lost. In that context, it is not terribly surprising that there are no surviving intermediates between bacteria and eukaryotes. * Some sort of structural constraint must have acted equally on both of the two great domains of prokaryotes, the bacteria and archaea, forcing both groups to remain simple in their morphology throughout an incomprehensible 4 billion years. Only eukaryotes explored the realm of complexity and they did so via an explosive monophyletic radiation that implies a release from whatever these structural constraints might have been. That appears to have happened just once - all eukaryotes are related. * The chapter sets up the book‚Äôs central argument: that energetic constraints‚Äîrather than solely genetic or chemical factors‚Äîare pivotal in shaping life‚Äôs evolution <br> ## What is living? <br> "

Sterner <small style=\"display:block; text-align:center; color:gray;\"> Created 24 Aug, 2025 </small> <br> \"Master any skill or challenge by learning to love the process\" <br> ## 1. The Learning Begins We do things like driving a car without much thinking. That comes from practice. Do everything from practice. <br> ## 2. Process, Not Product * When you're doing something, 'be here now!' Do not think about expectations, stress, how you're doing, etc. * Make the 'process' the goal, not the 'product'. Product follows automatically once the process is done well. * Do not learn passively, practive actively. * To state Bhagavad Gita (not mentioned in the book): ``` Karmanye Vadhikaraste (‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á): You have a right to perform your actions or duty.

It's How You Look at It \"At what point in a flower's life, from seed to full bloom, does it reach perfection?\" * Do not keep expecting a future ideal self. Live in the present, every moment is ideal. Being here now is what most religions teach too. <br> <br> "

When entities (abstract/real) combine, ‚Äú[Emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence)‚Äù occurs. An object formed from the combination of entities has a new set of behavior/meaning that the entities themselves do not have on their own. It‚Äôs why Aristotle said ‚ÄòThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts‚Äô. Take human cells for example, they have no idea that a combination of many of them can form a human being who is conscious, alive, and achieves things that the individual cells could never do. ## Rise of Meaning Simpler organisms like bacteria, plants do not experience much emotions. Simpler animals exhibit more emotions, but still are not as conscious as as. They do experience pain, pleasure. But they do not comprehend concepts that the more complex animals, humans do. So meaning increases with increase in complexity, due to increase in emergence. But what about beings even more complex than us? ## Fall of Meaning? With rise in Artificial Intelligence capabilities, computers can now generate masterpiece paintings, award winning photographs/novels/movies, you name it. So whatever human does, is it valuable anymore? Why do anything anyway? Here‚Äôs why, more intelligent beings may or may not mean loss of meaning, even if they are ‚Äòmore‚Äô emergent than humans: They may see meaning, but incomprehensible to us: It‚Äôs possible that ‚Äòmeaning‚Äô only means to us, and we don‚Äôt see much meaning in things that higher organisms do. Look at plants or an animal. They never understand why we use social media or go to the gym. They may not see meaning after all: Due to higher intelligence, they don‚Äôt have the normal feelings as we do. They may see everything without much emotions and hence see it as meaningless. We may see meaning: Humans always adapt to new things and discover meaning. So its possible we maybe able to see the meaning once we get there. Isn‚Äôt it? Will AI destroy meaning for us? Or will we discover new meaning and be all okay? <br> "

Introduction to Deep Medicine [‚Üë Contents](#contents) * I hope to convince you that deep medicine is both possible and highly desirable. Combining the power of humans and machines‚Äî intelligence both human and artificial‚Äî would take medicine to an unprecedented level. There are plenty of obstacles, as we‚Äôll see. The path won‚Äôt be easy, and the end is a long way off. But with the right guard rails, medicine can get there. The increased efficiency and workflow could either be used to squeeze clinicians more, or the gift of time could be turned back to patients‚Äî to use the future to bring back the past. The latter objective will require human activism, especially among clinicians, to stand up for the best interest of patients. Like the teenage students of Parkland rallying against gun violence, medical professionals need to be prepared to fight against some powerful vested interests, to not blow this opportunity to stand up for the primacy of patient care, as has been the case all too often in the past. The rise of machines has to be accompanied by heightened humaneness‚Äî with more time together, compassion, and tenderness‚Äî to make the ‚Äúcare‚Äù in healthcare real. To restore and promote care. Period. <br> ## 2. Shallow Medicine [‚Üë Contents](#contents) * I hope that I‚Äôve been able to convince you that the shallow medicine we practice today is resulting in extraordinary waste, suboptimal outcomes, and unnecessary harm. Shallow medicine is unintelligent medicine. This recognition is especially apropos in the information era, a time when we have the ability to generate and process seemingly unlimited data about and for any individual. To go deep. To go long and thick with our health data. That body of data‚Äî Big Data per individual‚Äî has the potential to promote the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment. * We‚Äôre not yet using it because it‚Äôs far more than any human, any doctor can deal with. That‚Äôs why we need to change the way we make medical diagnoses, the fundamental decision process of clinicians. <br> ## 3. Medical Diagnosis [‚Üë Contents](#contents) * But Bayes‚Äôs theorem relies on priors, and, because we, as inexperienced medical students, had visited so many books but so few patients, we didn‚Äôt have much to go on. The method would leave aged physicians, who had seen thousands of patients, in far better stead. * New tech will decrease the value gap between the experienced doctors and the inexperienced ones. Meaning younger doctors can expect to be as good as the experienced ones with the help of tech. * These data point to the serious problems with how physicians diagnose. System 1‚Äî what I call fast medicine‚Äî is malfunctioning, and so many other of our habitual ways of making an accurate diagnosis can be improved. We could promote System 2 diagnostic reasoning. Kahneman has argued that ‚Äúthe way to block errors that originate in System 1 is simple in principle: recognize the signs that you are in a cognitive minefield, slow down and ask for reinforcement from System 2.‚Äù * But to date, albeit with limited study, the idea that we can supplement System 1 with System 2 hasn‚Äôt held up: when doctors have gone into analytic mode and consciously slowed down, diagnostic accuracy has not demonstrably improved. * A major factor is that the use of System 1 or System 2 thinking is not the only relevant variable; other issues come into play as well. One is a lack of emphasis on diagnostic skills in medical education. * Failure to diagnose or delay in diagnosis are the most important reasons for malpractice litigation in the United States, which in 2017 accounted for 31 percent of lawsuits. 21 When the affected physicians were asked what they would have done differently, the most common response was to have had better chart documentation, which"

Welcome to 2025 * Large Language Models (LLMs) are the dominant type of models that make for most of the AI. * May not be the best or the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), which are the points that are equivalent to, or surpass human level of intelligence. * AGI could come in 2030-2035, says the Nobel laureate and DeepMind CEO [Demis Hassabis](https://youtu.be/M2ZtBQI2-GY?si=KmuY7H9rb4SE6u1O). * Google is outperforming all other models in most tasks with their Gemini 2.5 Pro (NLP) and Veo 3 (Video generation) models. The previously King in AI is back, it seems. * Google's offerings are also nuts, giving free access to API and developers. * There are other types of models catching up, like JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture from Meta, latest: V-JEPA), which has a more grounded undertanding of the physical world, meant for robots and other applications aiming to achieve Artifical Machine Intelligence (AMI). AMI could be one of pathways to AGI. <br> ## 2a. Nature of LLMs * üìàAre **stochastic (probabilistic) simulations** of people * üß†üòïHave **anterograde amnesia** - they do not know of anything beyond the point of their training * üß†ü§Ø**ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) behaviour, hallucination**: Get distracted in their vast amount of knowledge easily. * üß†ü§ì**Jagged intelligence**: smart mostly, but dumb a few times. When asked how many '*r*'s are there in '_strawberry_', they often say the wrong answer. This is mainly because computers do not think the way we do, their thinking is upside down - They can do rational/complex math more easily than do intuitive simple tasks like identify a fruit in a basket. For a two year old human, identifying a fruit is easier than doing complex math. (more on [How We The Humans Build](https://karthikeshwar1.github.io/blog/2025/How_We_The_Humans_Build) * üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ùå**Don't continuously learn or think autonomously** * üò¥‚ùå**Don't sleep after that to consolidate knowledge** or insight, expertise into weights (that happens only when the model is being created): Humans do that every night. * ü§î‚ùå**Lack true reasoning and understanding**: As they're just stochastic simulations of people, they really lack true understanding * üî†‚ùåüî¢‚úÖ**They see tokens, not letters or words**: LLMs think in terms of tokens, each word is converted to a token for the model to process and once that is done, it is converted back to word for you to read. <br> ## 2b. Some more things about LLMs * üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§îüñ•Ô∏èüî§**Unlike Humans**: LLMs are just probabilistic next-token (a token is a math representation of words) prediction systems. Although they're pretty useful, _they process language and predict the next group of words in a statistical manner. A) It is not how humans think_. Humans think in terms of mental representations of objects and events, not language. B) It means that it can only say things out of the data it was trained on, with some degree of creativity. * ‚ùì**They cannot make new discoveries or inventions**: Because they do not asks questions or act on their own. They lack curiosity and true agency. * **LLms can't be AGI** As [Yann Lecun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvNCVYkHKfg) says, LLMs are much limited and do not have true reasoning and human-like thinking capabilities. ## 2c. What's next on LLMs Like the airplane isn't exactly like the birds, and the submarine isn't exactly like fish, maybe AI need not be exactly like humans... Maybe the LLMs are the way to go... or maybe not... Maybe there's something better than LLMs, which works like humans... or maybe unlike humans... <br> ## 3. How to deal with AI * AI needs to be kept in leash, says [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ) * We need to **augment**‚úÖ the AI like the Ironman does with his suit, instead of letting AI do it all the **agentic**‚ùå way. <br> ## 4. A brief interlude on BioTech * Biggest revolutions of this century (after the Internet): 1. **AI (Software + Hardware)**: The software wave is already here. The hardware/robotics wave is next‚Äîand it's not far behind. This revolution is moving fast, largely because it doesn‚Äôt need heavy regulation to scale. 3. **BioTech**: Possibly even more transformative and more ethically complex. Its pace may be slower due to strict regulations, as it directly involves the human body. But its implications run deeper: it will force humanity to rethink morality, identity, and what it means to be human. Neuralink, for instance, is already tackling things like blindness and aims to augment human capabilities in ways that could permanently reshape how we live. BioTech is being accelerated by AI, and "

    "content": "# Words Weigh Non-living objects communicate through physics (the 4 fundamental forces, chemical bonds, etc) Non-human living objects (microscopic/animals/birds/etc.) communicate with a little more sophisticated ways, but they're not self-aware (not to level of humans). If some exceptional animal did learn to be self-aware, like a üê¨ or an ü¶ß, what it speaks wouldn't be understandable by its friends. 1. Human communication is a highly sophisticated mechanism, thanks to the big brain. This communication is a result of years of understanding of reality . Hence our words reflect the real world and its laws. 2. Also, since humans are the most self-aware species, the words carry a lot of importance. Now, some animals can sing and have complicated sounds as well, but they're neither self-aware, nor do their sounds have the level of complexity as humans do. 3. Also, a single human speaking in a desert carries no importance. Hence, words only have meaning when the species is social. Some holy scriptures (Hindu and Christian - I haven't read them) seemed to have said that the capacity that words have to shape reality is akin to the process that generates reality itself. "

    "content": "# Software Architecture Foundations *Notes from various sources including the [LinkedIn Learning course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/software-architecture-foundations) by Allen Holub* <br> * Software architect designs the structure of a complete system. * A good architect starts with the customer needs and works down towards the implementation. <br> ## The Architect ### The Agile Architect vs The Traditional Architect The traditional (waterfall model) architect thinks he's the sole designer of the system, above everyone who implements the project. ### üëé Drawbacks of the traditional architect: 1. Doesn't capture the users' true needs 2. Big and complex designs 1. code is written after the design 2. doesn't allow for learning 3. Lack of flexibility 1. painful bureaucratic processes 2. not following the design 4. Slow development process 1. centralized architect-making decisions 2. wasted time & money * UMLs are a joke. <p align=\"center\"> <img align=\"center\" src=\"https://bellekens.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/crossinglinesdiagram.png\" width=\"300px\"> </p> * The too-detailed diagram becomes redundant when it's as complicated as the code and also makes it hard to adapt to new changes. * In Agile, you: <p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"./images/sa1.png\" width=\"300px\"> </p> * This would be ideally a 2-day max cycle. <br> | Agile | Traditional | | ---- | --- | | Everybody is an architect | Single architect | | Nobody asks permission to experiment | Architect controls permissions | | Nudges/suggests towards better decisions | Orders | <br> * Agile architect's job is to *teach, coach and coordinate*. He's a servant leader. His main design responsibility is to assure coherence across the system. * A good architect is also a good developer. * Good architecture: * Simplicity * Maintainability * Testability <br> ## Thinking Architecturally ### Conway's Law *Any organization that designs a system... will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mel Conway <br> * With siloed teams, you end up with something called N-Tier system, where the database, business logic and the user-interface are all different and inefficiently organized. * In agile world, you work on thin vertical slices of work throughout the entire system (as opposed to horizontal slices of work for each department). * All departments work on small goals all at once (as opposed to each team trying to work on different goals). * A narrow piece of work that results in something useful for the end-user is called a story. All teams work on this story. <br> | Big Upfront Design (BUFD or Waterfall) | Agile | | --- | --- | | Design the whole plan and then start implementing | Plan a bit, implement and reiterate, things may change, that's how nature works | | Siloed teams, slowed processes | Quick interacting teams, active and agile processes, that's what nature likes | | They try to come up with universal design for modules, no room for context | Context matters, nature isn't perfect | | Here you start by designing the database, and then business logic and then UI | Start with the work that your customers have to do (e.g., use case) | | Need to decide early what technology to use | Defer technology based on the above | | Focus is on the implementation technology | Focus is on the customer needs | | Parts that customer sees becomes an afterthought | Technology is deferred into last responsible moment | <br> * **Domain Driven Development (DDD)**: An agile methodology, states that the structure of your code should map the structure of the problem domain. * DDD solves Conway's law problem. E.g., if you're writing an accounting system, your modules/classes should represent accountants, ledgers, balance sheets, etc. * Bounded context: The idea of bounded context is that there are natural divisions within the business whose problems we're solving. * *Remember that the models reflect the business, not the implementation technology* * Ubiquitous language in DDD: Speak the same language of your customers. The same word can mean different things under different contexts. This is okay. <h3 align=\"center\"><i> context matters </i></h3> * E.g., Both customer and store employee may have 'order_item' but the type of orders may be different. * In Big Upfront world, architects try to come up with universal notion of modules. * Then design becomes hard, for e.g., two separate modules for 'order_item' or biiig names like 'order_item_customer' and 'order_item_employee'. <br> * **Agents**: In programs, modules communicate through portals. In microservices architecture, the context becomes small standalone programs that run independently. These course grained implementation units can be called objects. But a better word is agents. * Agents functionalities gotta be abstracted. * Agent technologies: 1. Messaging: simplify communication across a network 2. Caching 3. Logging 4. Monitoring: resource "

No wonder Friedrich Nietzsche said 'God is dead' in the 19th century, when science started to boom. So God is nothing but mystery. This implies that if we solve all mysteries, then we know God - he's could be just the most powerful being to exist. That's not incomprehensible. We have people who control a lot of things and are extremely powerful - God could just be the ultimate version. But we don't know that. Also, we haven't solved all mysteries yet. If we solve the mystery of God, then God is dead. We don't know if we ever will. Does free will exist? This question remains unanswered. Hence we may never solve the mystery of God. Or will we? But we can definitely say that the proposition for a God to 'not exist' is higher today than ever. "

    "content": "<h1 align=\"center\"> Security Systems </h1> <h2 align=\"center\"> The Flaw and The Ultimate Solution </h2> <small style=\"display:block; text-align:center; color:gray;\"> Created 12 Nov, 2023 </small> <br> <h5 align=\"center\"> <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f5/Padlock-red-silver.svg/240px-Padlock-red-silver.svg.png\"> </h5> From the lock and key to the computer and smartphone PINs and passwords, the systems that secure your valuables have been not very intelligent. 1. The authentication system rely on simple factors like keys/passwords which are prone to losing/forgetting. 2. They really don't know if the right person is accessing the valuable or not. A bad guy who has the key or knows the password can easily break the protection barrier. <br> ### Moving on from conventional security: Biometrics The biometrics system really tried to solve the above two problems. It was only possible with the sophistication of technology, hence we're enjoying the security of **fingerprints**, **face ID**, etc. these days. But unfortunately, 1. Still many websites and apps require you to type some password. Because they can't access the fingerprint/infrared interface of the hardware that you're using. 2. Even relying on just your fingerprint or facial recognition means that it's only relying on _one_ factor. In case you bruise your finger or face (Apple confidently said that its face ID technology adapts to your changing face with beards, etc), these devices still ask for a PIN or a password. So basically a PIN or a password are still the ultimate layer of security, because guess what, they really aren't smart enough to detect if its really _you_ or hacker. <br> ### The Ultimate Level Security What if the security system was as good as a human being in intelligence? What if the security system is powered by AI? Then, **Pros:** 1. It can _really_ detect if its you or not, even if you bruise your finger or damage your face. You see, human decision making is not simple or based on 1 or 2 factors. Its complex, based on multiple factors, and there are fuzzy areas. A sufficiently good AI can authenticate based on multiple factors without the use of additional dependencies like passowrds or keys. **Cons** Some of the flaws of humans may get slipped into the AI as well. A simple one factor key or password is hard to crack if it's made sufficiently tough. An AI, being as complex as it is, has many factors and doors open to manipulate/interact. But of course, that can be modified as the AI need not necessarily have all the human flaws. They don't forget, for example. We can design it in such a way that it also doesn't fall to emotional or hypnotic traps. A solid AI-powered security system, is hence the ultimate security system. <br> "

    "content": "<h1 align=\"center\">Why Different Domains Require Different Approaches:</h1> <h3 align=\"center\">Lessons from Microsoft, Apple, Wework, Netflix, and Uber/Ola</h3> <br> ##### Created 2023/11/4 <br> Different domains require different approaches. What works in one field may not work in another. Each area has its own complexities and nuances that demand careful attention. ### Microsoft's failure in the smartphone industry <h6 align=\"center\"> <img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/attentuatinginnovation-2.png?w=240&ssl=1\" /> </h6> Microsoft assumed that the smartphone should resemble a computer OS. Apple, on the other hand, adopted a completely different strategy for the smartphone, and tailored it to its form factor. This is one of the main reasons why Microsoft failed to capture the smartphone market. <br> ### Apple couldn't to the TV what it did to the smartphone industry As [Steve Jobs himself put it (in 2010)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5f8bqYYwps&t=3675s), 1. Even if they design the best set-top-box, it was hard to get into the market. The existing market used the Go-To-Market strategy and the set-top boxes were subsidized. 2. The cable operators fragmented, every country has it's own standards and regulations. <br> ### WeWork is filing for bankruptcy WeWork failed to succeed and one of the factors was the fragmentation of the office industry. Their concept of a one-size-fits-all office space did not work well. <br> ### Netflix Games Netflix tried to apply its subscription model to the video game industry with its service Netflix Games, but it was cancelled after less than a year due to low subscriber engagement. The selection and type of games didn't exactly pick up with neither the pro gamers nor the casual gamers. <br> ### Sometimes you can enter a totally different market, like Uber/Ola did, and be successful The taxi industry was and still is (in some places) dominated by the locals. Uber/Ola had to enter an already established market and compete with them. The reason why they were successful is that they understood what the customer wanted: convenience and affordability. The easy access through the app, the variety of options available, and a bit of safety assurance made Uber/Ola popular. <br> ## The Reasons they failed The reasons all the above companies failed (among other reasons) is that they all had a fixed mindset on how things are supposed to work. Successful products were never launched with a fixed product and an idea/belief that worked in another area. They had embraced a little uncertainity. They also didn't understand that people are inventing use-cases constantly. Steve Jobs and his team had no idea how much the idea of an app store and apps would explode. The art lies in balancing the well-known fixed notions with some uncertainity. <br> "

Visceral (appearance) 2. Behavioral (function) 1. Function 2. Performance 3. Usability 3. Reflective (the story that it tells) * \"...... The car is so much fun to look at and drive......\" * Emotions help us make decisions. <br> ## Part 1: The Meaning of Things ### 1. Attractive Things Work Better * Being happy broadens the thought processes and facilitates creative thinking * Being anxious narrows the thought processes, concentrating upon aspects directly related to the problem * This is a useful strategy in escaping from danger, but not in thinking of creative approaches to solve a problem * So happy people (pleased with the aesthetics) are more open to solve problems * Different levels of brain: * Visceral: automatic/prewired, lowest * Behavioral * Reflective: contemplative, conscious, highest * In negative situations, you are focused. More resources are put into visceral level. * When you are positive, you are relaxed. Thinking broadens and you are in reflective state, far less focused. * E.g. in a plant monitoring room, in case of a dangerous event, it should create a negative effect so as to keep the operators more focused. Alarm sounds, red lights spinning and pulsing, etc. * Don't overdo it though, coz too much anxiety creates a tunnel vision, making the brain to think nothing at all. **Visceral** * Visceral level is incapable of reasoning, of comparing a situation with past history. * It works by what cognitive scientists call \"pattern matching\" * People are genetically programmed for those situations and objects that, throughout evolutionary history, offer food, warmth, or protection, which have positive effects. * These conditions include: * warm, comfortably lit places, temperate climate, sweet tastes and smells, bright, highly saturated hues, \"soothing\" sounds and simple melodies and rhythms, harmonious music and sounds, caresses, smiling faces, rhythmic beats, \"attractive\" people, symmetrical objects, rounded, smooth objects, \"sensuous\" feelings, sounds, and shapes. * Similarly, conditions that produce automatic negative effects: * heights, sudden, unexpected loud sounds or bright lights, \"looming\" objects (objects that appear to be about to hit the observer),extreme hot or cold, darkness, extremely bright lights or loud sounds, empty, flat terrain (deserts), rotting smells, decaying foods harsh, abrupt sounds, grating and discordant sounds, misshapen human bodies, snakes and spiders, human feces (and its smell), other people's body fluids, vomit. crowded dense terrain (jungles or forests), crowds of people, bitter tastes, sharp objects. * Above list isn't perfect, and humans change ### 2. The Multiple Faces of Emotion and Design * The Macintosh was regarded as 'too playful' for workplaces. Although it was same as any other business computer. **Feelings of self:** * The heathkit, which was used to build radio and other electronics from kit parts, was very popular among its customers as they felt a sense of accomplishment. More so than actual electronic experts, as the hobbyists went out of their expertise to do it. * Betty Crocker Company introduced a cake mix which didn't pick up, as it was too easy to make, hence leaving no connection with the person and no sense of accomplishment. Later they improved it by adding an extra method. <br> # Part 2: Design in Practice ### 3. Three Levels of Design: Visceral, Behavioral and Reflective * Four important aspects of behavioral design: * Function * Understandability * Usability * Predicting the popularity of a new product is hard * Understand end-user's unmet and unarticulated needs is also hard. E.g. cup holders in floor cleaning machines * The secret to good understanding of the product by the user, is to establish a proper conceptual model of the product * Three mental images of any object: * Designer's model * User's model (=designer's model in an ideal world) * System image (product with its written material) <h6 align=\"center\"> <img src=\"./images/Emotional_Design_Conceptual_models.png\" /> The designer‚Äôs model, the system image and the user‚Äôs model (Source: the book) </h6> <br> **Designers vs users** * Focus groups, questionnaires, surveys, etc. are poor ways for learning about behaviour because they are divorced from actual use * The makers get so attached with the product that they fail to see the product in the way the unattached user sees it * The exception is when the makers use the product themselves. This is why best products come from fields like sports, athletic, craft, etc. as they are made and used by the same group of people * Steve jobs made the computers to be used by himself more than anyone. Hence the excellence **The reflective design** * The overall impact of a product comes through re"

Biosimilars are more difficult to manufacture (because they're created from living cells) and are not exact copies of original biologics (hence 'similar') * Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs: do not require a physician to be administered. When a drug's patent period ends, most branded drugs become generics. If these generics gain widespread acceptance without serious complications or side effects, then the prescription limitation is lifted, allowing them to be sold directly over-the-counter. * Vaccines: drugs that stimulate patient's immune system to produce antibodies to a particular disease * **_In vitro diagnostics_** * tests done on samples such as blood or tissue that have been taken from the human body * Include: * Laboratory tests * Point-of-care (POC) tests * Over-the-counter (OTC) tests * **_Digital therapeutic_** * Clinically tested digital tools that help improve or manage medical conditions * **_Consumer care products_** * Include: * OTC drugs * Nutritional products * Personal healthcare products * Therapeutic Area means an area of medical practice that encompasses groupings of specific diseases and/or disorders generally treated by a specific medical specialty, such as oncology, cardiovascular, neurology or hematology * Just google 'therapeutic area' and you'll find therapeutic areas of various companies like Pfizer <br> ## üíπ Business Functions ##### (1) Research & Development (R&D) * Lifeline of life sciences companies * Drug development process: * Drug discovery * Preclinical testing * Application for testing approval * Regulatory pathways * Phase I testing * Phase II testing * Phase III testing * Approval * Manufacturing & marketing * Post market surveillance/Phase 4 testing * Some countries require regulators' approval before a drug is released there * Biopharma companies sometimes outsource some clinical testing to Contract Research Organizations (CROs) ##### (2) Manufacturing & Quality Assurance * Assure drugs quality standards * Monitor shelf life of products * Train company personnel ##### (3) Sales & Marketing * Providers * New drugs won't be purchased until physicians prescribe * Biopharma companies must market their drugs to providers so that they understand the approved uses, benefits and risks of their products * Payers * For providers or patients to be reimbursed for a drug's use, the drug must "

Providers 2. Patients 3. Third-party payers <br> ## üìÑ Healthcare Plans * Could be: 1. Group health insurance plans (e.g. employee health insurance) 2. Individual/private/personal health insurance 3. Specialty healthcare insurance plans (like dental or vision plans) * US healthcare plans types: * **Health Maintenance Organization (HMO):** * A type of health insurance plan that usually limits coverage to care from doctors who work for or contract with the HMO * It generally won't cover out-of-network care except in an emergency * An HMO may require you to live or work in its service area to be eligible for coverage * **Point Of Service (POS):** * Health insurance policy that allows the employee to choose between in-network and out-of-network healthcare products and services each time * **Preferred Provider Organization (PPO):** * Medicare arrangement where availing medical services like consultations, hospitals and medicines are all provided for a cost lesser than it usually is under this plan * Have higher premiums and higher level of cost-sharing than HMO or POS plans <br> ## üë®‚Äçüíª Claims Processing * Also called Claims Adjudication * It's the insurance company's procedure to check the claim requests for adequate information, validation, justification and authenticity * Many payers outsource claims processing to other payers * Claims processing begins when a provider delivers medical care to a patient * The medical care provided is translated into numeric codes.

It's our environment which determines which genes get activated/expressed. So it's we who control our lives. * 99% of diseases didn't come from genes but from lifestyle and environment [1] * Our genes make their day to day decisions based on chemical information they receive from the food we eat [2] * We can change the expression of more than 70% of the genes that have a direct bearing on our health and longevity [3] * There are good and bad calories. 100 calories of doughnuts isn't the same as 100 calories of spinach. * Even if you take 1000 calories per day, if it's 90% carbohydrates, then you'll gain weight. If it's 90% fat or protein, you'll lose weight. * When insulin levels are elevated, we accumulate fat in our fat tissue, when these levels fall, we liberate fat from our fat tissue and burn it for fuel [4] * Carbohydrate is driving insulin. Insulin is driving fat. [5] * Artificial substitutes of natural food items could be bad, coz our body, through evolution, is more suited to natural food. * Fat and cholesterol aren't the sole reasons why heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, etc. are caused * Eat more natural food <br> # What to avoid * Avoid artificial fats. Refined bleached deodorized vegetable oils are the most dangerous. * Vegetable oils are highly chemically unstable. They oxidize. So they're harmful. They increase inflammation, which contributes to just about every chronic disease. * Plant foods contains 64 times more anti-oxidants than animal foods * Vegetable oils are undoubtedly the most unnatural product we eat in any significant amount, says Dr. Cate [2] * Harmful fats: Sunflower oil, rice bran oil, canola oil, soy oil, cottonseed oil, grapeseed oil, safflower oil * Safe fats: avocado oil, macadamia nut oil, olive oil, peanut oil, butter, ghee, coconut oil, animal fats * Avoid harmful carbs. Sugar is present in most food, and is dangerous. * 2 Whole wheat bread slices are equivalent to a can of sugar-sweetened soda * Bread, pasta, potatoes, rice are little more than containers for sugar. A 7 ounce serving of cooked spaghetti is converted into the amount of sugar contained in 4 twelve-ounce Pepsi cans!

    "content": "<h1 align=\"center\">AI in 2022</h1> <h1 align=\"center\">üåÖüåÜ</h1> <br> ## The Obvious AI will be doing some/most part of our jobs. They're simply much better and cheaper. <br> ## It Knows both Good and Bad, and It has No Incentive to be Biased Any AI in this universe which knows lesser negativity than what is present in reality, is less intelligent. Besides, AI will eventually observe everything evil from nature itself. Since AI doesn't experience pain or pleasure, it has (almost) no incentive to be biased towards Good or Bad. <br> ## Don't you Underestimate Although AI doesn't have a soul, it can do pretty much everything much better than humans, except maybe one or two things. As of 2022, AI capabilites are convincing enough. <br> ## The Impact Just like most things in this universe [refer to KK's OG Notes book by Karthikeshwar], AI is bound to have both Good and Bad sides. So what might potentially happen is that it will do both Good and Bad things at large scales. <br> ## Brace Yourselves Humanity fucked it up when they first discovered nuclear energy. Thankfully, nuclear power was only present in a few hands. AI could be present in potentially every single hand. So we better be prepared to make sure we don't become slaves, or worse yet, erase ourselves into extinction. Woah woah, wait a second... It won't all be so dramatic. In a way, we already are slaves to technology, although it ain't so 1984-esque. Also, all hell won't break loose over night. Things will change slowly and gradually, and we're already riding the wave. But still, it's better to be prepared than to gamble with everything at stake. <br> <h1 align=\"center\">‚úåÔ∏èü§û</h1> <br> "
